"Real-time insights for spotless performance". an application that focuses on reporting the cleaning activities of machines in a factory, including details such as the last cleaning time, duration, water usage, and energy usage. Relevant for CPG, like beer breweries and coffee-roasting factories.

## what we are aiming for
Real-time information into a high-tech industrial control room with multiple digital dashboards showing live data feeds. One dashboard highlights real-time cleaning activities of robotic and automated machines in a brewery and factory. Screens display animated timelines, sensor graphs, heatmaps of machine cleanliness, and event logs. Overlaid holographic UI elements show Solace PubSub+ messaging icons, AI analytics charts, and alerts. In the background, factory floors and brewing tanks are visible through glass walls, with autonomous cleaning robots in action. "Powered by CleanPulse AI".
